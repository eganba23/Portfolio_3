# Automation of a Monte Carlo Simulation

Welcome back!

This project stemmed from my frustrations as a Teaching Assistant with my class size. Here I provide a description of the problem of obtaining a distriubtion of sample means with a small class size, and demonstrate how to conduct (and automate) a monte carlo simulation.

Credit is due to Dr. Wayne Pratt and Dr. Eric Stone, as they created and updated the labs this project is designed upon.
